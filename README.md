#Raspberry Pi Zero Cookbook
This is the code repository for [Raspberry Pi Zero Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/raspberry-pi-zero-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786463852), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Go to MaptRaspberry Pi Zero, one of the most inexpensive, fully-functional computers available, is a powerful and revolutionary product developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Raspberry Pi Zero opens up a new world for the makers out there. This book will give you expertise with Raspberry Pi Zero, providing all the necessary recipes that will get you up and running.


##Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
@app.route('/update_pin', methods=['POST'])
def update_pin():
        #Read in form entry. Since they are all buttons, you should only get
```

The operating system used in this book is the open source Raspbian, designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi family of computers.

Pretty much any part in this book, outside of common components such as resistors and capacitors, is available through Adafruit. Adafruit sells high-quality components and boards that are great for all kinds of Internet of Things and maker projects. Purchasing each piece individually can add up fast; fortunately, sites such as Amazon offer some great kits that are perfect for beginners. The Elegoo Most Complete Ultimate Starter Kit is the one I used. It costs around $60 US and includes most of the sensors, displays, and motors used in this cookbook as well as common components, such as a breadboard, jumper wires, power supplies, LEDs, resistors, and capacitors. It is a great way to get started! Everything marked with an asterisk (*) is something that is included in the Elegoo kit. In the specific recipes, I will reference the equivalent Adafruit part if available.
